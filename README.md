# Grokking the Coding Interview Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems from the "Grokking the Coding Interview" course on Educative. The course offers a comprehensive collection of coding interview questions, covering various topics and patterns frequently encountered in technical interviews.

## ðŸ“š Course Overview

The "Grokking the Coding Interview" course provides a structured approach to understanding and mastering common coding interview problems. It covers essential topics such as:

- Array Manipulation
- Two-Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Binary Search
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dynamic Programming
- and many more...

Each problem in the course is accompanied by a detailed explanation, step-by-step walkthroughs, and multiple solutions with varying levels of complexity.

## ðŸš€ Solutions

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the coding problems presented in the course. Each solution is provided in a separate file, along with occasional comments describing the approach, time complexity, and any additional insights or optimizations. The solutions are organized by topic and pattern, making it easier to navigate and find specific problems.

Feel free to explore the solutions, learn from them, and use them as a reference when preparing for coding interviews or improving your problem-solving skills.
